# Frameworks
- Architectures half implemented and generic (agnostics to the applications)
- They provide a skeleton with basic functionality intended to be extended.
- The modules of the framework dictate the control flow
- Tradeoff between (extensibility and reusability) and modifiability 
# Plugins
- The basic systems is atomic and independent, can work without plugins
- Plugins add functionalities
- Contrary to frameworks, the plugins improve the experience of the user more than that of the developer
- Plugin extending a plugin is possible, but often plugin extends the base system
- Flexibility and extensibility is improve, but losing on maintainability

# Ecosystem
- Collection of modules which have something in common (language, framework, ...)
- Model for os systems
- Contributions managed by the community, they specify regulations and habits
